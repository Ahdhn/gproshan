### geometry processing and shape analysis framework

![](gproshan.png) 


## Description
This framework include some algorithms of geometry processing and shape analysis as part of our
graduate research.

## Build and Run
Install all dependencies and run:

	make

finally execute:

	./gproshan [input mesh paths]

### Dependencies (linux)
g++ 7.2, cuda >= 9.1, libarmadillo, libeigen, libsuitesparse, libopenblas, opengl, gnuplot, libcgal

## Contributions

### CHE implementation
We have implemented the [a Compact Half-Edge data structure (CHE)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.523.7580), to manipulated the meshes. (See the paper: [CHE: A scalable topological data structure for triangular meshes](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.523.7580)

### Geodesics
Fast Marching, Heat Method.
**We proposed a new parallel algorithm to compute geodesics**.
See our paper... @Bronstein2008

### Dictionary Learning
**We proposed a Dictionary Learning technique** in order to solve the problems of Denoising, Inpainting and Multiresolution.
See our technical report.

### Hole repairing
We implemented repairing mesh holes in two steps:

1. Generate a mesh to cover the hole (modified algorithm base on ...).
2. Approximate the curvature solving the Poisson equation and using Biharmonic splines.

### Decimation
We are implementing the algorithm ?? to decimate a mesh. 

### Fairing
Spectral and Taubin algorithms.

### Laplacian and signatures
Laplace-Beltrami operator and its eigen decomposition, WKS, HKS, GPS signatures.

## Documentation
Execute:

	doxygen Doxyfile

to generate the documentation in html and latex.

## Viewer
The viewer was initially based in the viewer of [https://github.com/dgpdec/course](https://github.com/dgpdec/course). The current viewer use VAO and VBO to render, and the shaders have been modified and upgraded.
