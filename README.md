## Contributions

### CHE implementation
We have implemented a [Compact Half-Edge (CHE)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.523.7580) data structure to manipulated triangular meshes, also can be extended for other polygonal meshes.
See the paper: [CHE: A scalable topological data structure for triangular meshes](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.523.7580) for more details.

### Geodesics
We proposed a CPU/GPU parallel algorithm to compute geodesics distances on triangular meshes. Our
approach is competitive with the current methods and is simple to implement. Please cite our paper:

[An Iterative Parallel Algorithm for Computing Geodesic Distances on Triangular Meshes]()

}
```

Also, we have implemented the [Fast Marching algorithm](), and the [Heat method](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/HeatMethod/index.html).

### Dictionary Learning
We proposed a Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding framework, to solve the problems of Denoising,
Inpainting, and Multiresolution on triangular meshes. This work is still in process. Please cite
our work:

### Hole repairing
We implemented repairing mesh holes in two steps:

1. Generate a mesh to cover the hole. We modified the algorithm presented in the paper: [A robust hole-filling algorithm for triangular mesh](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-007-0167-y), in order to
generate a planar triangular mesh using a priority queue.
2. Fit the surface described by the new points in order to minimize the variation of the surface,
solving the Poisson equation (see the Chapter 4 of the book [Polygon Mesh Processing](http://www.pmp-book.org/)) or using Biharmonic splines.

Please see and cite our [report](http://repositorio.unsa.edu.pe/handle/UNSA/2576) (in Spanish) as
final undergraduate project.

### Decimation
We are implementing the algorithm described by the paper [Stellar Mesh Simplification Using Probabilistic Optimization](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2004.00811.x),
to compute a mesh simplification.

### Fairing
We implemented Spectral and Taubin fairing algorithms to smooth a mesh surface.
See the Chapter 4 of the book [Polygon Mesh Processing](http://www.pmp-book.org/).

### Laplacian and signatures
Laplace-Beltrami operator and its eigen decomposition, WKS, HKS, GPS signatures.

Execute:

	doxygen Doxyfile

to generate the documentation in html and latex.

## Viewer
The viewer was initially based in the viewer of [https://github.com/dgpdec/course](https://github.com/dgpdec/course). The current viewer uses VAO and VBO to render, and the shaders have been modified and upgraded.
